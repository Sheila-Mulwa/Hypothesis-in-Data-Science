Linear Regression and Modeling
This repository contains code and resources for understanding and implementing linear regression models for predictive analytics and statistical modeling.

Overview
Linear regression is a fundamental statistical technique used for modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It is widely employed in various fields, including economics, finance, healthcare, and social sciences, for tasks such as forecasting, hypothesis testing, and understanding the impact of predictor variables on the target variable.

This repository serves as a resource for learning and implementing linear regression models, covering both theoretical concepts and practical applications.

Contents
Code: Implementation of linear regression models in Python using libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
Datasets: Sample datasets for experimentation and model training.
Notebooks: Jupyter notebooks demonstrating step-by-step explanations and code snippets for implementing linear regression models.
Resources: Additional reading materials, tutorials, and references for further exploration.

Key Concepts Covered
Simple Linear Regression
Multiple Linear Regression
Model Evaluation Metrics (e.g., R-squared, Mean Squared Error)
Assumptions of Linear Regression
